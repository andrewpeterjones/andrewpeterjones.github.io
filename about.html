	<h2>Hey! I'm Andrew</h2>
	<p>A recent graduate of Yoobee School of Design and keen traveller, just returned home from a three month OE in Europe with my fianceÃÅ.</p>
	<p>I've worked as a professional dancer/choreographer for over ten years, working both nationally and internationally. I've co-directed two companies and worked in the world of fashion for numerous years. Returning home from a year London, while running my second company, I taught myself to use the Adobe Creative Suite for all our digital, video and print needs. Continued learning at Yoobee helped expand my knowledge and refined my skills, ideas and design thinking. I now hold a Diploma in Graphic and Web Design. I also developed a keen interest for front-end web design which lead me to build this portfolio via Github.</p> 
	<p>Outside of work, my interests and time lie in fashion, design, travel, health and fitness, food and coffee but most of all, family!</p>
