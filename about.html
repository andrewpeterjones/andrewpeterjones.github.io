	<h2>Hey! I'm Andrew</h2>
	<p>A junior designer and recent graduate of Yoobee School of Design in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
	<p>I've been working as a professional dancer/choreographer for over ten years now, both nationally and internationally. During this time I've co-directed two dance companies and worked in the world of fashion for numerous years. Returning home from a year in London, while running my second company, I taught myself to use the Adobe Creative Suite for all our digital, video and print needs. Continued learning at Yoobee helped expand my knowledge and refined my skills, ideas and design thinking. During this time I developed a keen interest for front-end web design which lead me to build this portfolio via GitHub.</p> 
	<p>Outside of work, my interests and time lie in fashion, design, travel, fitness, food and quality coffee!!</p>
