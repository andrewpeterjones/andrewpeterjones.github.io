	<p id="aboutp">Hey! I'm Andrew, a Junior Graphic Designer and 2017 graduate of Yoobee School of Design here in Auckland.</p>
	<p id="aboutp">My varied background includes work as a leading professional Dancer, Choreographer and Teacher for over ten years, working both nationally and internationally. During this time, Iâ€™ve co-directed two successful dance companies and worked in the world of fashion and retail for a number of years.</p>
	<p id="aboutp">Originally a self taught designer, I worked on projects covering a broad range of deliverables for my company FACULTY. Following this, studying through Yoobee helped expand my knowledge and refined my skills, ideas and design thinking. I have a strong interest and passion in both Graphic and Web Design.</p>
