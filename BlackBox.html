	<h2>Black Box Boutique</h2>
	<br>
	<p>This street campaign was for one of Black Box Boutiqueâ€™s quarterly sales held at the Grey Lynn location. After reviewing some of their older work and sticking to their brand guidelines I created the poster that was placed in 40 various CBD and Fringe locations by SHOUT Media. This was also sent out through their social channels.</p>

	<p>They wanted certain brands to be front and center and also the use of neon pink (that was being used on the Grey Lynn's store front doors at the time) to be the main feature and catching point of the design.</p>
